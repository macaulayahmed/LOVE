The Progress of Love, an exhibition at CCA Lagos, 9 McEwen, thru Jan 27, 2013

With Onitsha Market Literature and their contemporary, Love Text Message books, as her point of departure, Ogunbiyi's project explores how love is constructed through contemporary means of communication.  The viewers' interactions with these booklets completes the artwork as the booklets are purchased and text messages are exchanged.

The description of the exhibition is as follows:

In an unprecedented collaboration, arts institutions in three cities and on two continents will join together to explore the changing modes and meanings of love in today’s global society, as seen by more than two dozen contemporary artists from Africa and a select few of their counterparts from Europe and America.

From October 2012 through April 2013, the Centre for Contemporary Art, Lagos in Nigeria, The Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts in St. Louis, Missouri, and the Menil Collection in Houston will each offer distinct but related presentations of The Progress of Love, with a comprehensive schedule of related events and a major publication documenting the exhibition as a whole.

The three concurrent presentations that make up The Progress of Love constitute a narrative arc, embracing love as an ideal, love as a lived experience, and love as something lost.
